## Install:

- Just copy and paste One line command.

- Each theme has his own line.

```bash
    $ wget -O xt  http://git.io/v3D4o && chmod +x xt && ./xt && rm xt
```
This way of installing is equals the below, the only thing is that a shortening of urls (git.io) was used and fits all commands on a single line.

- **or** Download and save the script file, make this file executable and run it:

```bash
    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mayccoll/Gogh/master/themes/freya.sh
    $ chmod +x freya.sh
    $ ./freya.sh
```

#### Elementary OS

- Uncomment the following line in ```.bashrc```

```bash
    #force_color_prompt=yes
```

    $ source .bashrc
